Multi-Class Animal Recognition for Wildlife Conservation
Project Overview
This project aims to classify wildlife species using deep learning to aid conservation efforts. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of various animal species. The system can process images uploaded by users and return the predicted species with confidence scores.
